Tampercurl is a php-class that will take an XML file containing HTTP-headers exported by the Firefox plugin TamperData.
It will then set up a cURL session mimicking these HTTP-headers and give you control over the flow of execution as well as the 
possibility to customize the HTTP-headers further. After the configuration is done launch the request and get the data back. 
It is possible to reuse connections, but remember that the cURL settings you specified during an earlier launch will 
not be automaticly reverted (this can be specified though).

It is possible to load up multiple headers specified in one XML file, with the load*header() functions you can control what
header is initialized for execution.

Notice: It is ofcourse advisible to remove everything you don't want from the XML file, 'host' property is automaticly 
skipped as this is derived from the url in the header but especially the cookie property is error prone in combination 
with a custom set cookiejar.

Dependencies:
+ PHP cURL
o TamperData for Firefox (not a requirement for the execution of this script, but it's used for the generation of the XML files)

Bugs:
+ A bug in TamperData causes the character ':' to be converted to %253A (instead of %3A) when it is found in POST-keys
  I'm not sure whether this is a problem with special characters in general or just ':', same for @
